What’s in the Box?</B></U></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Dropbox,
Inc. a private company founded out of San Francisco, CA is one of the
fastest growing file-hosting databases. Its competitors include
Apple, Microsoft, Google, Box, and the never-ending list of
up-and-coming startups looking to reshape file-hosting. Its platform
offers users the ability to save and share files including documents,
photos, music, and videos for free (upcharge for increased storage or
enterprise). With over 200 million users in 2013, there are
approximately two hundred million files saved to Dropbox each day.
That’s more files than tweets tweeted per minute! Although Dropbox
is user friendly and has a multitude of applications that the average
laymen consumer can utilize and enjoy, it serves an even bigger role
in business. As of 2013, Dropbox served over 4 million businesses
including 97% of the Fortune 500 according to techcrunch. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The
company’s founding CEO, Drew Houston, started Dropbox as a solution
to a forgotten thumbdrive on a bus and the need to have his work
accessible to him anywhere. In today’s mobile market, Dropbox
solves a consumer need and serves individuals and companies looking
for cloud-storage and file sharing on a secure interface. Following
its initial development, Dropbox later released a Dropbox for
Business and a Datastore API to increase its enterprise platform. The
Business application allows professionals to manage their personal
and work files as separate entities on one interface. It also allows
IT departments to audit who is sharing what with whom and when, an
account transfer feature, and a Remote Wipe to preserve corporate
security. The Datastore API saves metadata to the cloud to assist app
developers as well as the Drop-Ins API that lets outside apps
incorporate a user’s Dropbox files. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Dropbox
is constantly expanding to provide services to more users on more
devices. It has recently collaborated with Microsoft bringing Dropbox
functionality to the Microsoft Office network of desktop applications
and Microsoft tablet and smartphone running Windows software. The
company closed a deal with CloudOn, an Israeli based tech company
focused on developing mobile productivity according to the Dropbox
website. The Carousel app launched at the end of last year speaks to
Dropbox’s commitment to being user-friendly by allowing users the
ability to free up storage space in just one-touch/tap. Dropbox is
not without faults. According to VentureBeat it only recently updated
it’s app to allow shared links to be opened for iOS and Android and
added the Open Button to desktop clients. The fact that the company
is just now attempting to close the gaps in its mobile app is
alarming for the everyday consumer. Perhaps it has been too focused
on its enterprising platform and business developments thus
forgetting about the average Joe. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Despite
its early support and interest from members of the investment
community, Dropbox has largely underperformed financially when
compared to other companies like SnapChat considering its potential
for financial growth and the Forbes predictions of its presence in
the business market and cloud-computing field. It is up for debate
about whether or not this is intentional on behalf of the company
leadership in an effort to under report its user count to hide that
Dropbox is growing slowly but worth more than reported. The
alternative is the startup’s competitors are giving them a run for
their money-literally. While is financial credibility can be debated,
it is clear that Dropbox serves a technological purpose that
currently satisfies millions of consumers each day. That being said,
it’s likely we will all continue to store and share files on its
interface until the next big file-hosting idea emerges. </FONT>
